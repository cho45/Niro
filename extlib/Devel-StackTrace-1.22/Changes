1.22  Jul 15, 2009

- Apparently, overload::StrVal on older Perls (5.8.5, but not 5.8.8)
  tried to call a stringification method if it existed. So now,
  Devel::StackTrace just uses overload::AddrRef instead, which should
  always be safe. Reported by Michael Stevens. Fixes RT #47900.


1.21  Jul 1, 2009

- Overloaded objects which didn't provide a stringification method
  cause Devel::StackTrace to die when respect_overload was
  true. Reported by Laurent Dami. RT #39533.

- Added a frame_filter option which allows for fine-grained control
  over what frames are included in a trace. Based on (but expanded)
  from a patch proposed by Florian Ragwitz. RT #47415.


1.20  Oct 25, 2008

- The change in 1.15 to object creation broke the no_refs feature,
  causing references to be stored until the trace's frame objects were
  created.

* Exception::Class objects are always stringified by calling
  overload::StrVal().


1.1902  Jul 16, 2008

- This release just contains another test fix.

- The new tests for bad utf-8 apparently fail with any Perl before
  5.8.8. Reported by Lee Heagney. RT #37702.


1.1901  Jun 13, 2008

- This release just contains a test fix.

- The new tests for bad utf-8 fail with Perl 5.8.x where x <=
  6. Apparently, utf-8 was just more broken back then. Reported by
  Andreas Koenig's smokebots.


1.19  Jun 13, 2008

- Dropped support for Perl 5.005.

- If a function was in stack trace had been called with invalid utf-8
  bytes, this could cause stringifying a stack trace to blow up when
  it tried to stringify that argument. We now catch those (and other)
  errors and simply put "(bad utf-8)" or "?" in the stringified
  argument list. Reported by Alex Vandiver.


1.18  Mar 31, 2008

- Fix a test failure on Win32. No changes to the non-test code.


1.17  Mar 30, 2008

- Added a max_arg_length parameter, which if set causes
  Devel::StackTrace to truncate long strings when printing out a
  frame. RT #33519. Patch by Ian Burrell. 


1.16  Feb 2, 2008

- A test fix for bleadperl. The value of wantarray from caller() needs
  to be treated as a boolean, as opposed to expecting 0 (vs
  undef). RT #32583. Patch by Jerry Hedden.


1.15  Apr 28, 2007

- Changed how objects are created in order to greatly speed up the
  constructor. Instead of processing all the stack trace data when the
  object is first created, this is delayed until it is needed. This
  was done in order to help speed up Exception::Class. There are cases
  where code may be throwing many exceptions but never examining the
  stack traces.

  Here is a representative benchmark of object construction for the
  old code versus the new code:

          Rate  old  new
    old 1764/s   -- -76%
    new 7353/s 317%   --


1.14  Mar 16, 2007

- Added a few micro-optimizations from Ruslan Zakirov, who is hoping
  this will ultimately help speed up RT.


1.13  Apr 1, 2006

- Add another fix for filename handling in the tests. Tests were
  giving false failures on Win32 because the tests needed to use
  File::Spec->canonpath(), just like Devel::StackTrace does
  internally.


1.12  Sep 30, 2005

- Newer versions of Perl use Unix-style filenames when reporting the
  filename in caller(), which breaks Exception::Class tests on other
  platforms, and is just kind of funky.  This module now calls
  File::Spec->canonpath() to clean up the filename in each frame.
  Reported by Garret Goebel.


1.11  Apr 12, 2004

- No code changes, just switching to including a Makefile.PL that uses
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker instead of one that sneakily uses Module::Build.
  Requested by Perrin Harkins.


1.10  Mar 10, 2004

- Silence a warning from the test code if Exception::Class isn't
  installed.  Reported by Stefano Ruberti.

- Localize $@ to avoid overwriting a previously set $@ while creating
  a Devel::StackTrace object.  This caused a test failure in the
  Exception::Class tests when run with Perl 5.6.1, but not with 5.8.3.
  I don't really know how to test for it outside of Exception::Class.
  Reported by Jesse Erlbaum.


1.09  Feb 26, 2004

- The overload workaround blows up if a DBI handle is anywhere in the
  stack, because of a bad interaction between overload::Overloaded and
  DBI's custom dispatching.  This release works around that.


1.08  Feb 23, 2004

- Some tests failed on Win32 because they were hardcoded to expect a
  file name with forward slashes.  Reported by Steve Hay.


1.07  Feb 21, 2004

- This release includes a change to the overload handling that is
  necessary for cooperation with Exception::Class.


1.06  Feb 21, 2004

- Devel::StackTrace now uses overload::StrVal() to get the underlying
  string value of an overloaded object when creating a stack frame for
  display.  This can be turned off by setting respect_overload to a
  true value.  Suggested by Matt Sisk.


1.05  Feb 17, 2004

- Devel::StackTrace incorrectly reported that arguments were being
  passed to eval blocks (which isn't possible).  Reported by Mark
  Dedlow.


1.04  Sep 25, 2003

- The special handling of Exception::Class::Base objects was broken.
  This was exposed by the fact that Exception::Class 1.15 now uses
  Devel::StackTrace in a slightly different way than it did
  previously.


1.03  Jan 22, 2003

- Special handling of Exception::Class::Base objects when stringifying
  references.  This avoids infinite recursion between the two classes.


1.02  Sep 19, 2002

- Forgot to add Test::More to PREREQ_PM for previous releases.


1.01  Sep 18, 2002

- Change the "no object refs" feature to be a plain old "no refs"
  feature.  As was pointed out to me by Jean-Phillippe Bouchard, a
  plain reference (to an array, for example), can easily hold
  references to objects internally.  And since I'm not going to bother
  descending through nested data structures weeding out objects, this
  is an easier way to handle the problem.  Thanks to Jean-Phillippe
  Bouchard for a patch for this as well.

  The "no_object_refs" parameter is deprecated, and now does the same
  thing as the "no_refs" parameter.


1.00  Aug 23, 2002 (from Taiwan)

- Add an option to not store references to objects in stack frames.
  This can be important if you're expecting DESTROY to be called but a
  Devel::StackTraceFrame object is still holding a reference to your
  object(s).  Based on discussion with Tatsuhiko Miyagawa.


0.9   Nov 24, 2001

- Doc tweaks.


0.85

- doc bug fix that made it seem like args method was only available
  under Perl 5.6.0

- converted objects from pseudo-hashes to regular hashes.


0.8

- Should work under Perl 5.6.0+.

- Added hints & bitmask methods for use under Perl 5.6.0.


0.75

- Added frames method (and docs for it).

- Added 'use 5.005' which I should have put in there earlier.

- DOCS: explanation of 'top' and 'bottom' as they refer to the stack.

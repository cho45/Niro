NAME
    Config::Tiny - Read/Write .ini style files with as little code as
    possible

SYNOPSIS
        # In your configuration file
        rootproperty=blah

        [section]
        one=twp
        three= four
        Foo =Bar
        empty=

        # In your program
        use Config::Tiny;

        # Create a config
        my $Config = Config::Tiny->new();

        # Open the config
        $Config = Config::Tiny->read( 'file.conf' );

        # Reading properties
        my $rootproperty = $Config->{_}->{rootproperty};
        my $one = $Config->{section}->{one};
        my $Foo = $Config->{section}->{Foo};

        # Changing data
        $Config->{newsection} = { this => 'that' }; # Add a section
        $Config->{section}->{Foo} = 'Not Bar!';     # Change a value
        delete $Config->{_};                        # Delete a value or section

        # Save a config
        $Config->write( 'file.conf' );

DESCRIPTION
    "Config::Tiny" is a perl class to read and write .ini style
    configuration files with as little code as possible, reducing load time
    and memory overhead. Most of the time it is accepted that Perl
    applications use a lot of memory and modules. The "::Tiny" family of
    modules is specifically intended to provide an ultralight alternative to
    the standard modules.

    This module is primarily for reading human written files, and anything
    we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you need
    something with more power move up to Config::Simple, Config::General or
    one of the many other "Config::" modules. To rephrase, Config::Tiny does
    not preserve your comments, whitespace, or the order of your config
    file.

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
    Files are the same format as for windows .ini files. For example:

            [section]
            var1=value1
            var2=value2

    If a property is outside of a section at the beginning of a file, it
    will be assigned to the "root section", available at "$Config->{_}".

    Lines starting with '#' or ';' are considered comments and ignored, as
    are blank lines.

    When writing back to the config file, all comments, custom whitespace,
    and the ordering of your config file elements is discarded. If you need
    to keep the human elements of a config when writing back, upgrade to
    something better, this module is not for you.

METHODS
  new
    The constructor "new" creates and returns an empty "Config::Tiny"
    object.

  read $filename
    The "read" constructor reads a config file, and returns a new
    "Config::Tiny" object containing the properties in the file.

    Returns the object on success, or "undef" on error.

    When "read" fails, "Config::Tiny" sets an error message internally you
    can recover via "<Config::Tiny-"errstr>>. Although in some cases a
    failed "read" will also set the operating system error variable $!, not
    all errors do and you should not rely on using the $! variable.

  read_string $string;
    The "read_string" method takes as argument the contents of a config file
    as a string and returns the "Config::Tiny" object for it.

  write $filename
    The "write" method generates the file content for the properties, and
    writes it to disk to the filename specified.

    Returns true on success or "undef" on error.

  write_string
    Generates the file content for the object and returns it as a string.

  errstr
    When an error occurs, you can retrieve the error message either from the
    $Config::Tiny::errstr variable, or using the "errstr()" method.

  property_string
    This method is called to produce the string used to represent the
    property in a section. It is passed the section name and property name.

  set
    This is a convenience is called to set a value found in the parsed
    config string. It is passed the section name, property name, and value.
